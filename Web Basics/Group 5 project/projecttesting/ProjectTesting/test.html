              Journey into the tropics at SereneStay Resort
          </h2><p>
              Renowned as one of Kenya’s enduring luxury resorts, Tropical West Kakamega’s hideaway SereneStay Resort opened in December 2015 following a million-dollar rebuild by John Kimani and Laurence Kirimi bringing the iconic lodge and location in the World Heritage-listed Kakamega Rainforest. John and Laurence met at a seminar on development and nature preservation and thereafter embarked on building the welcoming haven situated at the heart of this 200 square Kilometres ecological reserve.

              <aside class="sidebar"><h2>Disconnect to reconnect</h2>
                  We create a space and experience that gives individuals the freedom and permission they need to truly unplug and decompress. Participants put aside their digital arm to recharge, gain perspective, and reevaluate their relationship with digital technology. As we disconnect from our devices, we reconnect with ourselves, our community, nature and the world at large.

        <h2>Sustainable Practices at SereneStay</h2>
              Sensitive construction, creative recycling and other green practices have always been part and parcel to our development, and while we are honoured to have been so widely recognized for doing what, to us, comes naturally, we take even greater pride in the overwhelmingly positive comments we receive from visitors.
Our guests say they appreciate SereneStay’s eco-friendly blend of pristine nature and a casually luxurious built environment, and enjoy the flexibility and choice we offer in accommodations, amenities, meals, tours and expeditions.
